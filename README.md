# Pennybags
The board game tracker for people who play board games with me.

What it should do:
Allow you to select the board game being played, and the number of players, then display public knowledge (most commonly, the amount of money each person has)
Optional: after the first two are selected, allow you to toggle each item so that if you want to play a game where each person keeps the money private, you can.

Games to be added:

Firefly
-Money
-Wanted posters

Evolution: Climate
-Amount of food in watering hole
-Climate Tracker
